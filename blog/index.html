            <h2>The Brew Society Testing Core</h2>
            <h3>May, 2020</h3>
            <p>
              The Brew Society has long prided itself as being a source of
              quality information, but how can our programming advice be
              trusted? We have been asking ourselves this over the last few
              months and have come to realize that there is no real way to
              measure the impact that our tutorials were having on the
              community. Because of this, we have decided to start a new
              initiative: The Brew Society Testing Core. The testing core
              consists of two parts, the Quiz initiative and the Testing
              initiative.
            </p>
            <p>
              The quiz initiative will be the first tool released, coming out
              later this summer. In most cases, you will see it as a small 5-10
              question assesment following many articles. This assesment will
              evaluate how well you absorbed the materials from the reading, but
              it will also evaluate how well the article was written. The Brew
              Society will use the data collected from these assesments to
              determine what is the most potable way for information to be
              transfered into the minds of our readers. Should we start writing
              all of the articles using active voice? Should all of our articles
              contain images? Do jokes help the learning process? And do longer
              articles help or hurt the reader's education.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the quiz initiative is thououghly tested, the testing
              initiative will be rolled out. The ACT and SAT are prime examples
              of standardized scholastic tests- they determine what information
              the test-takers know. But, the major shortfall of these two exams
              is that they do not contain any sections relating to computer
              science. Because of this, there is no way to determine whether or
              not a student understands a certain programming language, or are
              just lying about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The backbone behind both of these programs is a strong focus on
              statistical anaylsis. As much as the assesments and exams are
              helping you determine your knowledge, they also let us improve our
              teaching skills. Because of this, we ask you to please not cheat
              on any of The Brew Society Testing Core Exams or Quizzes because
              it will lead to poorer quality articles being written and unfair
              grading systems to be put in place.

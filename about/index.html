          <h1>How Did We Start?</h1>
          <p>
            The Brew Society started as the 'coding club' at Greens Farms
            Academy. From there, William McGonagle, one of the coding clubs
            founders, decided to create an overarching organization similar to
            those that hosted competitions. He did not enjoy the rigid nature of
            the challenges, and unsupportive nature that the programming world
            facillitated. So, he went on a mission to change that.
          </p>

          <h1>Why Are Our Challenges Different?</h1>
          <p>
            The Brew Society puts a strong emphasis on making our challenges as
            realistic as possible, but we also want them to be fun, so we focus
            on walking that thin line. We mostly start our challenges with a
            general theme, like 'space'. From there, we start looking asking
            questions about the theme- like 'how would hyperspeed travel work?'.
            And finally, we take a jab on creating a challenge query that will
            act as a framework for the answer to the theme's question. For
            instance, 'Create a function to find a path through a field of
            spheres from Point A to Point B'.
          </p>

          <h1>How Do We Profit?</h1>
          <p>
            The Brew Society is a 501(c) corperation, that means we are a
            non-profit. So, for the short answer of the question, we don't
            profit off of any of this. The reason we choose to be a non-profit
            was because, from our inception, we had the mission to teach
            programming to all of the people that wanted to learn. We knew that
            there were good learning resources online, but we knew that to gain
            access to those resources, students had to watch hours of ads or
            sell their souls. So, we came along to offer great resources and
            oportunities for those who naturally could not have access to them.
          </p>

          <h1>Who Are Our Competitors?</h1>
          <p>
            We don't have any. Yes, there are people who offer similar
            experiences to ours, but since we do not have any advertisements or
            paid learning products, we don't feel like we are competing against
            any of them. We would actually love to work with people who offer
            similar learning resources, so if there are any of them out there
            that would like to collaborate, please get in contact. Other than
            that, learning should be free and possitive for all, so we do not
            punish any users if they do not enjoy our learning style, and would
            rather opt-in for a different learning platform.

              <p>
                Stephen Gary Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), also known by his
                nickname "Woz", is an American electronics engineer, computer
                programmer, philanthropist, and technology entrepreneur. In
                1976, he co-founded Apple Inc. with business partner Steve Jobs,
                which later became the world's largest information technology
                company by revenue and the largest company in the world by
                market capitalization. Through their work at Apple in the 1970s
                and 1980s, he and Jobs are widely recognized as two prominent
                pioneers of the personal computer revolution.

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <p>
            In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple I into the computer
            that launched Apple when he and Jobs first began marketing it the
            following year. He primarily designed the Apple II, introduced in
            1977, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced
            microcomputers, while Jobs oversaw the development of its
            foam-molded plastic case and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed
            the switching power supply. With software engineer Jef Raskin,
            Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the
            original Apple Macintosh concepts from 1979 to 1981, when Jobs took
            over the project following Wozniak's brief departure from the
            company due to a traumatic airplane accident. After permanently
            leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and created the first
            programmable universal remote, released in 1987. He then pursued
            several other businesses and philanthropic ventures throughout his
            career, focusing largely on technology in Kâ€“12 schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of November 2019, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a
            ceremonial capacity since stepping down in 1985. In recent years, he
            has helped fund multiple entrepreneurial efforts dealing in areas
            such as telecomunications, flash memory, technology and pop culture
            conventions, ecology, technical education and more.

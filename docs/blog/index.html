We have been asking ourselves this over the last few months and have come to realize that there is no real way to measure the impact that our tutorials were having on the community. Because of this, we have decided to start a new initiative: The Brew Society Testing Core. The testing core consists of two parts, the Quiz initiative and the Testing initiative. </p> <p> The quiz initiative will be the first tool released, coming out later this summer. In most cases, you will see it as a small 5-10 question assesment following many articles. This assesment will evaluate how well you absorbed the materials from the reading, but it will also evaluate how well the article was written. The Brew Society will use the data collected from these assesments to determine what is the most potable way for information to be transfered into the minds of our readers. Should we start writing all of the articles using active voice? Should all of our articles contain images? Do jokes help the learning process? And do longer articles help or hurt the reader's education. </p> <p> After the quiz initiative is thououghly tested, the testing initiative will be rolled out. The ACT and SAT are prime examples of standardized scholastic tests- they determine what information the test-takers know. But, the major shortfall of these two exams is that they do not contain any sections relating to computer science. Because of this, there is no way to determine whether or not a student understands a certain programming language, or are just lying about it. </p> <p> The backbone behind both of these programs is a strong focus on statistical anaylsis. As much as the assesments and exams are helping you determine your knowledge, they also let us improve our teaching skills. Because of this, we ask you to please not cheat on any of The Brew Society Testing Core Exams or Quizzes because it will lead to poorer quality articles being written and unfair grading systems to be put in place. </p> <p> <b> Thanks, <br> William M. </b> </p> </div> </article> </div> <footer> <p> <a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <a href="/copyright">Copyright</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/about">About</a> <br> <br> Â© The Brew Society, 2021. </p> </footer> </main> </body></html>

Our platform was built to ensure You will have the best learning experience possible without feeling uncomfortable with payments, advertising, or donations. This privacy policy applies to brew-society.github.io, and other online services (collectively, our “Service”), which are owned by The Brew Society. This document details the ways in which The Brew Society collects and uses information You provide to our Service, and describes choices you have in protecting, updating, and destroying Your information. </p> <p> As a 501(c) organization, the data collected is not used to earn a profit or revenue of any sort. Instead, the data is completely used to provide a better user experience. We were established as a non-profit so that our mission of “teaching every person in the world how to program” would not be interfered with. </p> <h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1> <ul> <li> <p> <strong>The Brew Society</strong> is the 501(c) with the name ‘The Brew Society’, who owns the domain brew-society.github.io. This company will be referred to as “The Brew Society”, “Brew Society”, “us”, or “we” for the remainder of the document. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Service</strong> is defined as any tools owned or operated by The Brew Society that have connectivity with any web-server or database owned or operated by The Brew Society. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>You</strong> is defined as the reader of the document or possible user of the Service. This refers to both users who may have account data and users who do not have account data. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Account Data</strong> is defined as any information collected and stored about You. Only users that have created an account under the ‘signup’ page have Account Data stored. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>API</strong> refers to an Application Programming Interface. The API is a series of URLs that contain data or functionality necessary for the running of the Service. The API for the Service is on ‘brew-society.herokuapp.com’, and it is not permitted for direct access (access not through the website ‘brew-society.github.io’) to this API. </p> </li> </ul> <h1 id="collection">Collection</h1> <p> If You are a user of the Service, but do not have an account, no personal information will be collected about You. The only information areas that are collected due to You are the viewership tallies. The viewership tallies are a number on some articles, pages, and videos that allow us to see how many people have viewed the said documents. None of this information can be linked back to you, if You do not have any Account Data. You accessing the article, page, or video simply increments the viewership tally on that document. No IP Addresses, Cookies, or Identifiers of any sort are used to show You have viewed the page. </p> <p> If You are a user of the Service, and you have an account, some pieces of information are collected about You. Most data-points are completely provided by You, the account owner. The data-points provided by You are referred to as Manual data-points. The data-points that the Service provides for You are referred to as Automatic data-points. </p> <ul> <li> <p> <strong>First and Last Name</strong> is stored as a string (varchar) in the database and is visible to all users of the Service. This is a Manual datapoint. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Email</strong> is stored as a string (text) in the database and is invisible to users of the Service unless otherwise specified. This is a Manual datapoint. </p> </li> </ul> <h1 id="choice">Choice</h1> <p> To access all of the learning resources from our Service, an account is not necessary. The account is only used to provide a more tailored experience and allows for extra features on the service to be utilized. Some examples of these extra services include but are not limited to: writing comments on articles, tracking the progress You have made on a course, or finding content that we think would enhance Your learning experience. </p> <p> Once an account is created, it needs to be connected to an email for any functionality relating to the account to be used. Email verification is not optional as it is used to prevent fake accounts from being created. </p> <p> When an account is created, the account owner can subscribe to weekly account updates. These updates detail new courses, events, and general information with regards to The Brew Society. These weekly account updates will also detail changes that may have occurred to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies. These weekly email updates can be unsubscribed or resubscribed to at any time. </p> <p> If You are not having a satisfactory experience with the Service or You simply want to delete Your account for other reasons, the option to do so can be found in the settings page of Your account. This will remove all comments that you have made, any personal account data linked with You, and any projects, data, or media that You have uploaded to the Service. Please note that an account can only be deleted by the owner of the account. If the account is not owned by You, but it is infringing on Your copyrights or You feel as though it violates the Terms and Conditions, please contact The Brew Society support team. </p> <h1 id="access">Access</h1> <p> Any person with access to the Service can access basic information about Your account. Basic information refers to any comments, media, reviews, that have been uploaded to the Service, as well as data-points directly stored on Your account (First and Last Name, Username, User ID, Description, and Profile Picture). </p> <p> The Brew Society does not have a public facing API, and does not permit any individuals or corporations to directly query our private API. This means that your data collected by the Service should not be mined by any groups. </p> <p> Since The Brew Society does not place any advertisements on the Service, we do not sell any of Your Account Data to companies or individuals. </p> <p> Access to any of Your Account Data on the Service is allowed by developers of the Service, and any staff of The Brew Society. This does not include Your password and Your private messages to any other users of the Service. </p> <h1 id="security">Security</h1> <p> The Brew Society prides itself on having a trustworthy Service, and therefore, we are on the forefront of cybersecurity methods. </p> <ul> <li> <p> The Service utilizes email verification and allows for account recovery though email. All account features are disabled until the user verifies their account. This is to prevent spam accounts from being created. Email verification also allows for account recoveries to be done. </p> </li> <li> <p> All passwords inside of our databases are ‘hashed’ and ‘salted’. In layman’s terms, ‘hashing’ means that the passwords are encrypted in one direction (Once the password is encrypted, it cannot be uncovered). Since password ‘hashing’ is not fully secure, ‘salting’ is another method we employ. ‘Salting’ is the process of adding extra data into the ‘hashed’ password so it is not as easy to discover. </p> </li> <li> <p> The Service forces all web connections to be done through HTTPS. This ensures that the possibly sensitive information that You may have submitted to the service is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by any third parties. </p> </li> </ul> </div> <footer> <p> <a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <a href="/about">About</a> <br> <br> © The Brew Society, 2021. </p> </footer> </body></html>

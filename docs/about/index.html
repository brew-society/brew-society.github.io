From there, William McGonagle, one of the coding clubs founders, decided to create an overarching organization similar to those that hosted competitions. He did not enjoy the rigid nature of the challenges, and unsupportive nature that the programming world facillitated. So, he went on a mission to change that. </p> <h1>Why Are Our Challenges Different?</h1> <p> The Brew Society puts a strong emphasis on making our challenges as realistic as possible, but we also want them to be fun, so we focus on walking that thin line. We mostly start our challenges with a general theme, like 'space'. From there, we start looking asking questions about the theme- like 'how would hyperspeed travel work?'. And finally, we take a jab on creating a challenge query that will act as a framework for the answer to the theme's question. For instance, 'Create a function to find a path through a field of spheres from Point A to Point B'. </p> <h1>How Do We Profit?</h1> <p> The Brew Society is a 501(c) corperation, that means we are a non-profit. So, for the short answer of the question, we don't profit off of any of this. The reason we choose to be a non-profit was because, from our inception, we had the mission to teach programming to all of the people that wanted to learn. We knew that there were good learning resources online, but we knew that to gain access to those resources, students had to watch hours of ads or sell their souls. So, we came along to offer great resources and oportunities for those who naturally could not have access to them. </p> <h1>Who Are Our Competitors?</h1> <p> We don't have any. Yes, there are people who offer similar experiences to ours, but since we do not have any advertisements or paid learning products, we don't feel like we are competing against any of them. We would actually love to work with people who offer similar learning resources, so if there are any of them out there that would like to collaborate, please get in contact. Other than that, learning should be free and possitive for all, so we do not punish any users if they do not enjoy our learning style, and would rather opt-in for a different learning platform. </p> </div> </div> <footer> <p> <a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <a href="/copyright">Copyright</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/about">About</a> <br> <br> Â© The Brew Society, 2021. </p> </footer> </main> </body></html>
